# BirthLens-India-s-Growing-Numbers-Decoded

A data-driven project analyzing India's historical population trends using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

📌 Overview
This project explores the evolution of birth rates and population density in India from 1950 to present. It combines:

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🤖 Machine Learning (Linear Regression)

🧠 Deep Learning (LSTM Time Series)

🗣️ NLP on Simulated Policy Documents

📁 Dataset
Source: Historical population dataset (CSV format)

Columns:

year: Year of record

population: Raw population number

Population_Density: People per km²

growth_rate: Annual % growth

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn for regression

TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM

WordCloud, CountVectorizer (scikit-learn) for NLP

🚀 How to Run
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow wordcloud
Run the notebook:

Open Birth_Rate_Analysis_India.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Step through each section (data load, EDA, ML, DL, NLP)

📊 Key Insights
Population is steadily rising, but the growth rate is gradually slowing.

Linear regression provides a simple baseline for forecasting.

LSTM performs better on population prediction as a time-series.

NLP reveals key policy themes like family planning and healthcare.

🧩 Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time policy/news text data via web scraping or APIs

Build interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash

Expand to regional/state-level population analysis
